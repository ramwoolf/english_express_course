			Mark: & \text{Good afternoon, Jeff} &\\
			& \text{How is it going?} &\\
			Jeff: & \text{Hi. I am slightly worried about} &\\
			& \text{ my job interview tomorrow morning}& \\
			Mark: & \text{Are you prepared well?} &(5)\\
			Jeff: & \text{Yes. I hope so.} &\\
			& \text{I had a prescreen call }& \\
			& \text{with talent acquisition specialist}& \\
			& \text{three days ago.} &\\
			& \text{And I waited their decision } &(10)\\
			& \text{until yesterday evening} &\\
			Mark: & \text{Sometimes HRs are quite slow} &\\
			& \text{And how was it?} &\\
			Jeff: & \text{That was OK, they scanned my CV} &\\
			& \text{and  my cover letter as well upfront.} & (15)\\
			& \text{So, I have got only actual questions} &\\
			Mark: & I am pretty sure, that is good signal. &\\
			& Ok, I will not distract you. &\\
			Jeff: & Wish me success tomorrow &\\
			Mark: & Break a leg! & (20)\\
			& ... &\\
			& (one day later) &\\
			& ... &\\
			Mark: & So, Jeff, how was your interview? &\\
			Jeff: & Nervous. &\\
			& They had lost my CV &\\
			& And started to ask everything once again &\\
			Mark: & And did you manage with that? & (25)\\
			Jeff: & Of course. &\\
			& Firstly, they asked a typical stuff, &\\
			& like "Introduce yourself"& \\
			& and "What is your experience". &\\
			& But then, I have got a few technical questions. & (30)\\
			& Couple of that were very simple. &\\
			& But the last one made me think hard &\\
			Mark: & And what was after that? &\\
			Jeff: & I was puzzled and simply confused &\\
			& by that question. & (35)\\
			& I think, I answered nonsense. &\\
			& But finally we have got a quite interesting discussion &\\
			Mark: & And what is the feedback? &\\
			Jeff: & I still don't know. &\\
			& They promised to provide the feedback & (40)\\
			& as soon as possible. &\\
			& So now I just want to relax about 30 minutes &\\
			Mark: & Ok, see you later. &\\
